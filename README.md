# PythonAPIProjects
In this github repository is all my python API projects I have created for the past few years

If you don't understand 90% of the trading terms I'm talking about, that's ok.

Here is some of the projects I made:

# Roblox Trade Bot 
This is my own trade bot where it scrapes users and sends gains for you. It includes a custom value algorithm that isn't fully developed yet. This bot uses threads and proxies to speed up scraping. I also need to fix the queue generator and the value algorithm which is not currently accurate. 

# Roblox Sniping Bot
Even though it looks super simple, its the first proxy-free sniping bot that existed. This is one of the accidental successes I had with botting, and it buys items for cheaper prices on the roblox limited market. I've made over $600 ($1,800 if I hadn't gotten banned) from this.

# Roblox Mass Send Bot
This program uses Website Scraping to find specific users to send to. It uses 3rd party website to find all tradeable users with the item specified in the config. This also uses proxies and threads to speed up generating the queue and sending trades. 

# Inbound/Outbound Checker
This was my 1st API program that I built, it checks your inbound/outbound for losses/wins, and uses caching system to reduce the number of API calls. 

# Sell Item Bot
It's pretty straight forward, it puts your item at the lowest price (if the existing user is not underselling) so that it can sell.
